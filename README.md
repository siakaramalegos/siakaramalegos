## Hi there 👋

I'm a freelance web performance engineer and web developer. I'm also an international conference speaker, workshop instructor, and community organizer. I like to make the web fast and build on Jamstack and serverless.

My services include:

- ⚡️ Performance engineering (coaching, training, workshops, auditing)
- 🕸️ Web application and website development
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 General coaching
- ✍️ Content development on web topics

On my website, [sia.codes](https://sia.codes/), you can learn more about me, read my blog, or contact me for a project or conference talk. Or, chat with me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sia.codes) or [Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@sia)!

## Support my work

I love supporting our tech (& art) communities through community organizing as well as writing and speaking on tech topics.

However, I'm a freelancer so I don't get paid 💸 to do any of this! You can help me make this more sustainable through sponsorship. Pick your preferred sponsorship provider:

- [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/siakaramalegos)
- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/siacodes)
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SiaKaramalegos)

Wondering what work I do for free?

- Organizing the Eleventy Meetup, PerformanceObserver, Durham Social Hack Night, and Durham Plein Air
- Building/maintaining the [NC Art Meets](https://ncartmeets.com) website and newsletter
