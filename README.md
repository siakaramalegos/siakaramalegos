## Hi there 👋

I'm a freelance web performance engineer and web developer. I'm also an international conference speaker, workshop instructor, and community organizer. I like to make the web fast and build on Jamstack and serverless.

My services include:

- ⚡️ Performance engineering (coaching, training, workshops, auditing)
- 🕸️ Web application and website development
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 General coaching
- ✍️ Content development on web topics

On my website, [sia.codes](https://sia.codes/), you can learn more about me, read my blog, or contact me for a project or conference talk. Or, chat with me on [Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@sia)!
